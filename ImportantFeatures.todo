This is a list of important features which should be added to the Package
  If the module for the feature already exists consider adding a TODO in the
  resepective file

Tree Functionionality:
  ☐ Nexus support for outputting trees
  ☐ Parser for newick trees
  ☐ proper unlist function for trees 
  ✔ Trees need to be rewritten in matrix format @done(2019-08-15 16:31) @project(Tree Functionionality)

General Features:
  ☐ Macros for model definition
  ☐ Automate export of automatically generated functoins
  ☐ Check if gpu can be leveraged
  ☐ Use matrix size as parameter and declare it constant (allows inlining)
  ☐ Write functionality to store entire posterior distribution

Likelihood Computation:
  ☐ make sure likelihood calculation can be done in parallel

Prior Distributions:
  ☐ make prior and constraint checking general

Utils:
  ☐ Make Utlis SIMD work with larger structures --> Careful Timing necessary
