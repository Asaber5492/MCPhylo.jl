This is a list of important features which should be added to the Package
  If the module for the feature already exists consider adding a TODO in the
  resepective file

Tree Functionionality:
  ☐ Nexus support for outputting trees
  ☐ RSPR tree move
  ☐ Parser for newick trees
  ☐ Check if support for non binary trees is necessary, or even networks
  ☐ Check if a more general datatype for the node data is needed
  ✔ data containers need appropriate size for internal nodes @done(2019-05-31 16:01) @project(Tree Functionionality)

General Features:
  ☐ Macros for model definition
  ☐ Automate export of automatically generated functoins
  ☐ Phylo should be a model subtype of a Mamba model

Likelihood Computation:
  ☐ make sure likelihood calculation can be done in parallel
  ✔ Dealing with missing character values @done(2019-07-22 11:14) @project(Likelihood Computation)

Prior Distributions:
  ☐ make prior and constraint checking general

Utils:
  ☐ Make Utlis SIMD work with larger structures --> Careful Timing necessary
